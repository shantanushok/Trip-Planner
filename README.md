# Trip-Planner
It is one of my android projects that I had developed while pursuing my diploma. Didn't want to use the gmaps api like everyone else so I decide to base this on graph hopper map engine and the map of my region in India . Previously I tried to integrate the engine directly into the app but it proved to be quite difficult to do so in the I went ahead with using the api's instead
